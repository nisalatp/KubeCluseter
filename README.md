**🧑‍🎓 If you're a beginner** — this project walks you through every stage of setting up Kubernetes, explaining what each command does and why it matters. You'll understand the infrastructure, not just run it.

**🏗️ If you're a professional** — use this to rapidly spin up disposable HA labs for testing, demos, or training. The scripts work on both Vagrant VMs and bare-metal / cloud servers.

## 🔭 What You'll Build

By the end of this guide, you'll have a fully working **highly-available (HA) Kubernetes cluster** with:

| Component | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **2 Load Balancers** | HAProxy instances fronting the API servers, with a Keepalived floating VIP for automatic failover |
| **3 Control Planes** | `kubeadm`-managed nodes running etcd, the API server, controller manager, and scheduler |
| **2 Workers** | Nodes that run your application pods |
| **Calico CNI** | Pod networking with VXLAN encapsulation |
| **containerd** | The container runtime (with `SystemdCgroup` properly configured) |

> **💡 Nisala's note:** The default topology is `2 LB + 3 CP + 2 WK`, but you can customise everything — even run `1 LB + 1 CP + 0 WK` on a tight laptop. The `configure.sh` wizard makes this painless.

```

> **💡 Nisala's note for beginners:** Don't worry if this looks complex — the scripts set up each layer automatically. I just want you to see the big picture of what you're building. In a production Kubernetes cluster, the load balancer layer is critical: if one load balancer fails, the VIP (Virtual IP) floats to the other, so your cluster API stays reachable. That's what "highly available" means.

## ✅ Prerequisites

### For Vagrant-based setup (recommended for learning)

| Tool | Minimum Version | Install Guide |
|------|----------------|---------------|
| **VirtualBox** | 7.0+ | [virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) |
| **Vagrant** | 2.4+ | [developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/install](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/install) |
| **RAM** | 10 GB free | The default 7-VM cluster uses ~10 GB. See [Resource Footprint](#-resource-footprint) for lighter configs. |
| **Disk** | ~5 GB free | Linked clones keep disk usage minimal. |

### For bare-metal / cloud servers

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **OS** | Debian 12 or Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 (any `apt`-based system with systemd) |
| **Network** | All nodes must be able to reach each other. Port `6443` must be open between load balancers and control planes. |
| **curl** | Must be installed on every node |
| **Root / sudo** | The scripts use `sudo` automatically when not running as root |

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1 — Clone This Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nisalatp/KubeCluseter.git
cd KubeCluseter
```

---

### Step 2 — Configure Your Cluster

Run the interactive configurator. It will ask you a series of questions and generate `cluster.yaml`:

```bash
./configure.sh
```

**What it asks you:**

| Question | Default | What It Means |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| Subnet (first 3 octets) | `192.168.56` | The private network your VMs will live on |
| Number of load balancers | `2` | How many HAProxy instances (2+ enables VIP failover) |
| Number of control planes | `3` | Must be **odd** (1, 3, 5, 7) so etcd can maintain quorum |
| Number of workers | `2` | Nodes that will run your application pods (0–9) |
| VIP host octet | `10` | The floating IP that always points to a healthy load balancer |
| Base box | `bento/debian-12` | The VM image — Debian 12 is the lightest (~120 MB idle RAM) |
| Kubernetes version | `v1.36` | The minor version of Kubernetes to install |
| Pod CIDR | `10.244.0.0/16` | The IP range for pods — **must not overlap** your subnet |
| Per-VM RAM | varies | Memory allocation per role (LB: 512 MB, CP: 2048 MB, WK: 1536 MB) |

> **💡 Nisala's tip for beginners:** Just press **Enter** on every question to accept the defaults. That gives you a solid, standard HA cluster. You can always re-run `./configure.sh` later to change things.

> **🏗️ Pro tip:** On a laptop with only 8 GB RAM, try `1 LB + 1 CP + 1 WK` with reduced memory (CP: 1800 MB, WK: 1024 MB). It won't be HA, but it's great for quick experiments.

---

### Step 3 — Create the Virtual Machines

```bash
vagrant up
```

This reads your `cluster.yaml` and creates all the VMs with:
- Correct hostnames (`k8s-lb1`, `k8s-cp1`, etc.)
- Static IPs on a host-only network
- `/etc/hosts` pre-populated so every node can resolve every other node by name
- `curl` pre-installed

**⏱ This takes 5–15 minutes** depending on your internet speed (it downloads the base box once, then uses linked clones).

---

### Step 4 — Set Up the Load Balancers

SSH into **each load balancer** and run the load balancer setup script:

```bash
# On k8s-lb1:
vagrant ssh k8s-lb1
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nisalatp/KubeCluseter/main/setup-loadbalancer.sh | bash
```

```bash
# On k8s-lb2:
vagrant ssh k8s-lb2
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nisalatp/KubeCluseter/main/setup-loadbalancer.sh | bash
```

**What happens inside the script:**

| Stage | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 — Gather settings | Reads your VIP, control-plane IPs (auto-detected from `cluster.yaml` on Vagrant) |
| 2 — Install | Installs `haproxy` and `keepalived` via apt |
| 3 — HAProxy config | Adds a TCP frontend on `:6443` that round-robins to your control-plane IPs |
| 4 — Keepalived VIP | Configures the floating VIP with VRRP (one node is MASTER, others are BACKUP) |
| 5 — Verify | Checks that port 6443 is listening and the VIP is assigned |

> **💡 Nisala's note:** When it asks **"Is this the PRIMARY (MASTER) load balancer?"** — say **yes** on `k8s-lb1` and **no** on `k8s-lb2`. The MASTER gets a higher VRRP priority so it holds the VIP by default. If it fails, the VIP automatically moves to the BACKUP.

> **⚠️ The backends will show as DOWN** at this point — that's completely normal. The control planes haven't been set up yet, so there's nothing listening on their `:6443`.

---

### Step 5 — Initialise the First Control Plane

This is the most important step. The first control plane bootstraps the entire cluster:

```bash
vagrant ssh k8s-cp1
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nisalatp/KubeCluseter/main/setup-controlplane.sh | bash
```

**When it asks "Is this the FIRST control plane?" — answer `yes`.**

**What happens inside the script:**

| Stage | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 — Settings | Confirms the VIP endpoint, node IP, Kubernetes version, pod CIDR |
| 2 — Swap | Disables swap (kubelet requires this) |
| 3 — Kernel | Loads `overlay` and `br_netfilter` modules; enables IP forwarding |
| 4 — containerd | Installs and configures containerd with `SystemdCgroup = true` |
| 5 — Kube tools | Adds the official Kubernetes apt repo; installs `kubeadm`, `kubelet`, `kubectl` |
| 6 — Init | Runs `kubeadm init` with `--control-plane-endpoint` pointing to the VIP |
| 7 — kubectl | Copies the admin kubeconfig to your home directory |
| 8 — Calico | Installs the Tigera operator and creates an IP pool matching your pod CIDR |
| 9 — Join commands | Generates and prints both the **control-plane join** and **worker join** commands |

> **💡 Nisala's note:** On Vagrant, the join commands are automatically saved to `/vagrant/join-commands.txt` — a shared folder that all VMs can access. This means when you run the scripts on the other nodes, the join command is **pre-filled** for you. Just press Enter.

---

### Step 6 — Join Additional Control Planes

```bash
# On k8s-cp2:
vagrant ssh k8s-cp2
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nisalatp/KubeCluseter/main/setup-controlplane.sh | bash

# On k8s-cp3:
vagrant ssh k8s-cp3
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nisalatp/KubeCluseter/main/setup-controlplane.sh | bash
```

**When it asks "Is this the FIRST control plane?" — answer `no`.**

The script will auto-detect the join command from `/vagrant/join-commands.txt`. Just press **Enter** when prompted.

---

### Step 7 — Join the Workers

```bash
# On k8s-w1:
vagrant ssh k8s-w1
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nisalatp/KubeCluseter/main/setup-worker.sh | bash

# On k8s-w2:
vagrant ssh k8s-w2
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nisalatp/KubeCluseter/main/setup-worker.sh | bash
```

The join command is auto-filled from `/vagrant/join-commands.txt`. Press **Enter** to accept it.

---

### Step 8 — Verify Your Cluster

SSH into any control plane and check:

```bash
vagrant ssh k8s-cp1

# All nodes should show "Ready" (may take 1-2 minutes for Calico to finish)
kubectl get nodes -o wide

# All system pods should be "Running"
kubectl get pods -A
```

**Expected output:**

```
NAME      STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION   INTERNAL-IP      ...
k8s-cp1   Ready    control-plane   10m   v1.36.x   192.168.56.11    ...
k8s-cp2   Ready    control-plane   8m    v1.36.x   192.168.56.12    ...
k8s-cp3   Ready    control-plane   6m    v1.36.x   192.168.56.13    ...
k8s-w1    Ready    <none>          4m    v1.36.x   192.168.56.21    ...
k8s-w2    Ready    <none>          3m    v1.36.x   192.168.56.22    ...
```

> **🎉 Congratulations!** You now have a production-grade HA Kubernetes cluster running on your machine.

---

## 🌐 Using on Bare Metal / Cloud Servers

The setup scripts are **not tied to Vagrant** — they work on any Debian/Ubuntu machine. The only difference is that you'll need to provide the join commands manually instead of them being auto-detected.

**On each server, run the appropriate script directly from GitHub:**

```bash
# Load balancers:
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nisalatp/KubeCluseter/main/setup-loadbalancer.sh | bash

# First control plane (answer "yes" to FIRST):
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nisalatp/KubeCluseter/main/setup-controlplane.sh | bash

# Additional control planes (answer "no" to FIRST, then paste the join command):
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nisalatp/KubeCluseter/main/setup-controlplane.sh | bash

# Workers (paste the worker join command when prompted):
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nisalatp/KubeCluseter/main/setup-worker.sh | bash
```

> **🏗️ Pro tip:** For production bare-metal setups, make sure your servers have DNS entries or `/etc/hosts` entries for each node hostname before running the scripts.

## 📐 Topology Reference

### Default Topology (2 + 3 + 2)

| Role | Hostname | Default IP | RAM | vCPUs |
|------|----------|-----------|-----|-------|
| VIP (floating) | `k8s-vip` | `192.168.56.10` | — | — |
| Load Balancer | `k8s-lb1` | `192.168.56.5` | 512 MB | 1 |
| Load Balancer | `k8s-lb2` | `192.168.56.6` | 512 MB | 1 |
| Control Plane | `k8s-cp1` | `192.168.56.11` | 2048 MB | 2 |
| Control Plane | `k8s-cp2` | `192.168.56.12` | 2048 MB | 2 |
| Control Plane | `k8s-cp3` | `192.168.56.13` | 2048 MB | 2 |
| Worker | `k8s-w1` | `192.168.56.21` | 1536 MB | 1 |
| Worker | `k8s-w2` | `192.168.56.22` | 1536 MB | 1 |

### Why Odd Control Planes?

Kubernetes uses **etcd** as its data store, and etcd requires a majority (quorum) to agree on writes:

| Control Planes | Quorum | Can Tolerate Failures |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 1 | 1 | 0 (no HA) |
| 3 | 2 | 1 |
| 5 | 3 | 2 |
| 7 | 4 | 3 |

With **3 control planes**, you can lose **1 node** and the cluster keeps running. That's why 3 is the recommended minimum for production.

---

## 💻 Resource Footprint

The VMs are tuned to be as light as possible on your machine:

| Optimisation | What It Does |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Minimal base box** | `bento/debian-12` idles at ~120 MB RAM per VM |
| **Linked clones** | All VMs share one base disk image instead of full copies |
| **Trimmed hardware** | 9 MB video RAM, no USB controller, no audio — headless VMs |
| **KVM paravirtualisation** | Better performance for Linux guests on VirtualBox |
| **Right-sized RAM** | Each role gets only what it needs |

### Memory Calculator

| Topology | Calculation | Total VM RAM |
|----------|------------|:------------:|
| 2 LB + 3 CP + 2 WK (default) | 2×512 + 3×2048 + 2×1536 | **~10 GB** |
| 1 LB + 3 CP + 1 WK | 1×512 + 3×2048 + 1×1536 | **~8 GB** |
| 1 LB + 1 CP + 1 WK | 1×512 + 1×2048 + 1×1536 | **~4 GB** |
| 1 LB + 1 CP + 0 WK | 1×512 + 1×2048 | **~2.5 GB** |

> **💡 Nisala's tip:** Leave **at least 4 GB free** for your host OS. If you have 16 GB total, the default 10 GB cluster is comfortable. On 8 GB, go with the 4 GB topology.

---

## ⚙️ Customisation Guide

### Change the topology

Re-run `./configure.sh` — it regenerates `cluster.yaml`. Then `vagrant destroy -f && vagrant up` to rebuild.

### Edit `cluster.yaml` directly

```yaml
# Example: add a third worker
workers:
  - { name: k8s-w1, ip: 192.168.56.21 }
  - { name: k8s-w2, ip: 192.168.56.22 }
  - { name: k8s-w3, ip: 192.168.56.23 }  # ← add this
```

### Change the Kubernetes version

Edit the `k8s_version` field in `cluster.yaml`:
```yaml
k8s_version: "v1.36"   # Change to v1.35, v1.34, etc.
```

### Use Ubuntu instead of Debian

```yaml
box: "bento/ubuntu-24.04"   # or "bento/ubuntu-22.04"
```

### Serve scripts locally (air-gapped networks)

If your VMs can't reach GitHub:

```bash
./serve.sh   # Starts a Python HTTP server on port 8000
```

Then use `http://<your-host-ip>:8000/setup-worker.sh` instead of the GitHub URLs.

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Nodes stuck in "NotReady" status

**Cause:** Calico pods haven't finished starting yet.

```bash
# Check Calico pod status
kubectl get pods -n calico-system

# Wait for all pods to be "Running" (usually takes 1-3 minutes)
watch kubectl get pods -A
```

### `kubeadm init` fails with "port 6443 already in use"

**Cause:** A previous attempt didn't clean up.

```bash
sudo kubeadm reset -f
sudo rm -rf /etc/kubernetes /var/lib/etcd $HOME/.kube
```

### Join token expired (after 24 hours)

**Cause:** `kubeadm` tokens expire after 24 hours by default.

```bash
# On any control plane, generate a new token:
kubeadm token create --print-join-command

# For control-plane joins, also upload new certs:
sudo kubeadm init phase upload-certs --upload-certs
```

### VIP not responding

```bash
# On each load balancer, check Keepalived:
sudo systemctl status keepalived
ip addr show eth1 | grep 192.168.56.10

# Check HAProxy:
sudo systemctl status haproxy
sudo haproxy -c -f /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
```

### Vagrant VMs fail to start

```bash
# Ensure VirtualBox host-only network exists:
VBoxManage list hostonlyifs

# If the network is missing, Vagrant creates it automatically on 'vagrant up'.
# If issues persist, try:
vagrant destroy -f
vagrant up
```

### Pod CIDR conflict

If you see pods stuck in `ContainerCreating` with network errors, your pod CIDR may overlap with your host network. Re-run `./configure.sh` and choose a different pod CIDR (e.g., `10.245.0.0/16`).

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use this for production?</strong></summary>

The scripts install production-grade components (kubeadm, containerd, Calico, HAProxy + Keepalived), but for a true production deployment you'd also want: TLS for etcd, node hardening, monitoring (Prometheus), logging (Fluentd/Loki), backup strategy (Velero), and proper DNS.

This project is designed primarily as a **learning and lab environment** that mirrors production architecture.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why <code>curl | bash</code>? Isn't that unsafe?</strong></summary>

For a controlled lab environment, it's convenient and standard practice (many tools like Docker, Homebrew, and Rust use this pattern). The scripts are in this public repo — you can read every line before running them. For production, clone the repo and run the scripts locally instead.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I add nodes after the cluster is built?</strong></summary>

Yes! Generate a new join token on any control plane (`kubeadm token create --print-join-command`) and run the appropriate setup script on the new node.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Do the scripts work on RHEL / CentOS / Fedora?</strong></summary>

Not yet — they use `apt-get`. Adapting them for `dnf`/`yum` is straightforward (the Kubernetes repo setup is the main change), but it's not currently supported.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What CNI plugins are supported?</strong></summary>

The scripts install **Calico** with VXLAN encapsulation. If you prefer Flannel, Cilium, or another CNI, skip the Calico stage in the control-plane script and install your preferred CNI manually after `kubeadm init`.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use this without Vagrant?</strong></summary>

Absolutely. See [Using on Bare Metal / Cloud Servers](#-using-on-bare-metal--cloud-servers). The scripts just need a Debian/Ubuntu machine with `curl` and `sudo` access.
